Mastery font file (Mastery.ttf) copied from the user's system.

Notes:
- The project references the Mastery font via @font-face in `src/styles/vars.css`.
- For better browser support and compression, consider converting the TTF to WOFF/WOFF2 and adding those formats.
- Make sure the font is permitted to be embedded and that you have the rights to package it in the project.
