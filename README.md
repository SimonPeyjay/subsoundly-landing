# Subsoundly Landing

A minimal React + Vite + TypeScript landing page scaffold for the Figma design (Subsoundly). This repo includes components, CSS modules and assets to implement the layout.

## Quick Start

Install dependencies and start dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

### Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Start the Vite dev server
- `npm run build` - Build the production site into `dist/`
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### Notes
- The design is implemented using CSS Modules in `src/components/` and global tokens in `src/styles/`.
- Replace placeholder assets in `src/assets/` with the images exported from Figma.
